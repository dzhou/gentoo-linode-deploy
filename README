Linode Gentoo 2010.0 64bit deployment script 
The default gentoo image on linode is on 2008.0 profile 
To be able to install any recent package you need to sync and update the 
system which is quite troublesome
 
This script will automate the update process and sort out all the blockers
Run with root from the same directory with the included configs
